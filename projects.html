        <h2 class="subheader">about my work ethic</h2>
        <p>i am a very driven and ambitious person, learning and loving technology since i was a young kid. i can learn very quickly, and adapt to new and struggling challenges i may face. i am very resourceful, being able to find a way through any bug or issue. the hard skills listed below are only the ones i can think of on the top of my head, but i can take on many challenges if needed of me. ^^</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">skillset</h2>
        <p>i have experience in discord bot development (specifically in python), python OOP programming (very rusty), and web development using html, css, and tools such as bootstrap. i'm also skilled in networking, server management, pc repair + building, as well as keyboard building (if this brings any use). creatively, i enjoy small music projects and digital art, and i’m familiar with both ios and android operating systems with plans to learn swift.</p>
        <p>currently, i'm learning as many technologies as i can, such as game development, cryptocurrency, and getting better at penetration testing. <strong>i'm always willing to learn anything new and expand my skill set.</strong></p>
        <p>i would love to learn more programming languages that can help me solidify my skills in development. i desire to learn more every day, and i would love to help out and be a member of any team.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">naviana</h2>
        <p>naviana is the game i have been creating and developing this past month, devlog will go here if im not lazy enough to actually update.</p>
